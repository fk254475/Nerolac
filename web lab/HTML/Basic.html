        <p>  1 :-  "He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;
			Who has enjoyed the trust of pure women, the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children;
			Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;
			Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth's beauty or failed to express it;
			Who has left the world better than he found it,
			Whether an improved poppy, a perfect poem, or a rescued soul;
			Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had;
			Whose life was an inspiration;
			Whose memory a benediction.”.</p>
    </div>
        <p><span class="sd">2 :- “You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
			Love like you'll never be hurt,
			Sing like there's nobody listening,
			And live like it's heaven on earth.”.</p>
